# Send Service Notices (New)

**Source:** https://open.seatalk.io/docs/messaging_send-service-notice_

## API Description

Use this API to send service notices to an employee/employees in SeaTalk. A service notice is a message specifically sent to the "Application Center" channel on SeaTalk. "Application Center" is a unidirectional message channel for SeaTalk Open Platform apps to push notices to a single app user/specific group of app users. Since the communication is unidirectional, users cannot send a reply in the channel. The channel will consolidate and display service notices from all apps used by a user. 

The type of service notice message can be customised. Currently, only [interactive message cards](/docs/interactive_msg_overview_) are supported as the available message type for service notices. See [Message Type](/docs/messaging_message_types_) for the design of different message types.

See an example of service notices sent to Application Center below:

Note:

- This API requires Send Service Notice (Internationalized) permission

- The recipient(s) of a service notice must be included in the app's Service Scope

- [As of 2022-05-19] For developers that have been using the historic version of this API (with the endpoint https://openapi.seatalk.io/messaging/v2/service_notice/i18n), please note that the historic version will be deprecated soon. We suggest you switch the API to the current one to improve the end-user experience. The functionalities will be the same, with the only change being the message format of service notices

Request Method: `POST`
