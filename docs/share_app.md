## Note The shared content must come from the current app and the web page needs to be working in order to be opened properly

- In the shared link, if there is any special character (see the doc here for examples) please use 'encodeURI' to code. Otherwise, an error will occur

- The latest version of this function was supported from SeaTalk 3.11.0 onwards, while the old Share function is still supported
