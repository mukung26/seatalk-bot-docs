# OpenAPI Pagination Standard 

**Source:** https://open.seatalk.io/docs/OpenAPI-Pagination-standard

In SeaTalk Open Platform, we use a "cursor"-based pagination method to divide a long list into multiple pages to improve the response time of server APIs. When you call a relevant API for the first time, the SeaTalk Open Platform server will store a "snapshot" of the result and send it back to you in smaller batches controlled by "page_size" and connected by "cursors". See the following for an introduction to how pagination is implemented so you can understand how specific server APIs are designed.

## How to Use the Pagination Function

In the first request of the server API, you need to provide us with the query info including:

- What is the list of entities the request wants to retrieve (e.g. a list of employees under department "Shopee &rarr; Singapore", or a list of departments under "Shopee &rarr; Singapore")

- What is the length of the list to be retrieved in this request (e.g. 10 items or 50 items)

### Example of a First Request (Body)

```
// Using example of Get Department API
{
"department_code": "SHOPEE APPS UAT",
"page_size": 10,
"fetch_child": "true"
}
```

SeaTalk Open Platform will respond with the desired segment of the data you want.

```
// For Get Department API
{
"code": 0,
"departments": [{
"department_code": "12",
"name": "Human Resource",
"department_alias": "",
"lead_employee_code": "998",
"visibility_info": [{
"is_hidden": false,
"hide_type": 0,
"department_whitelist": ["20", "21"]
}],
"direct_employee_count": 15,
"parent_department_code": "10"
},
{
... // Another department
},
... // More departments
],
"next_cursor": "MZYlo=TEc5VdXNlcjV0" // This cursor will be used in the next request. 
// If the "next_cursor" is empty, it means there is no more data left 
}
```

After receiving the response, you can put the "next_cursor" info into the "cursor" section in the new request together with the desired item length to get the next batch of responses and a new cursor.

### Example of a Following Request (Body)

```
// Using example of Get Department API
{
"department_code": "SHOPEE APPS UAT",
"page_size": 10,
"fetch_child": "true",
"cursor": "MZYlo=TEc5VdXNlcjV0"
}
```

Following this chain of requests and responses, you can get the full list of data.
