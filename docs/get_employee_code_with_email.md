# Get Employee Code With Email

**Source:** https://open.seatalk.io/docs/get-employee-code-with-email

## API Description

Use this API to exchange a user's email for employee_code. Employees with all types of employee statuses can be queried (i.e., pending, in position, leaving and terminated). 

If there is more than one employee with the same email, all their information will be returned. You can use the "employee_status" field in the response to differentiate between employees under different statuses. Because there might be more than one employee_code returned that points to one email, the exact ordering of the employee objects in the response might differ from the ordering of the emails passed in.

Note:

- This API requires Get Employee Code with Email permission.

- The "employee_status" field in the response is not supported in v1 of this API.

Request Method: `POST`
